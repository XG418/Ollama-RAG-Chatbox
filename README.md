# Ollama-RAG-Chatbox

## Overview  
This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built using Streamlit to answer user questions based on uploaded documents. Users can upload CSV, Excel, or PDF files, and the bot will extract relevant information from those documents to answer user questions. If the context from the documents is insufficient, the chatbot will inform the user.
